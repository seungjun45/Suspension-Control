# Suspension-Control
My undergraduate research with Professor Hyeongcheol Lee #ecsl.hanyang.ac.kr# (2013.01 ~ 2013.12).  Project goal was developing control algorithm for trailing arm suspension in Armored Vehicle. Each trailing arm is controlled by electric motor, where controller outputs are electric signal. I solved this problem with the proposed method "Advanced Adaptive Linear Quadratic controller". Recurdyn (Multi-body Dynamics Simulator) is used for conducting experiment. Here, I provide simulink (MATLAB) file of the proposed controller.

Technical paper of this project is available in Archive:
"Adaptive control for trailing arm suspension with hydraulic cylinder spring under practical constraints"
